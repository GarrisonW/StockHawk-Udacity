# StockHawk-Udacity
StockHowk is an Andorid App for  Udacity class project.  


##Installation Instructions

## Purpose

This was an existing application that was lacking in some key features and wsa in need of more graceful error handling.

As part of the requirements for the class project, the following was added:

 * Bug Fix: Application no longer crashes when a non-existant stock symbol is added.
 * Network isses (no connection, server down, no data) intercepted and reported as status
 * Stock history detail (closing price last 5 work days) activity added using WilliamsChart
 * Collection widget created
 * Preperations for Egyption version added

## Issues

WilliamsChart holds onto previous labels when new stock loaded.

## Proposed 

On the collection widget, individual stock on click should launch detail activity.
